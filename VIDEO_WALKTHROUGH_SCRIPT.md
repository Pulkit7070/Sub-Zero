## 📝 SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

### Visual: Landing Page (http://localhost:3000)

**Script:**

> "Welcome to Sub-Zero - the AI-powered subscription management platform that helps individuals and businesses take control of their SaaS spending.
>
> In this demo, I'll show you how Sub-Zero automatically discovers subscriptions, tracks utilization, and generates intelligent cost-saving recommendations.
>
> Let's start by looking at the two ways you can use Sub-Zero..."

### Actions:

## 📝 SCENE 2: Personal vs Enterprise Choice (0:30 - 1:15)

### Visual: Landing page - two-path selection

**Script:**

> "Sub-Zero offers two distinct paths:
>
> First, we have the **Personal mode** - designed for individuals who want to manage their personal subscriptions. Simply connect your Gmail account with read-only access, and our AI scans your emails to discover all your subscriptions - Netflix, Spotify, gym memberships, and more.
>
> Second, there's **Enterprise mode** - built for organizations that need centralized control over company-wide SaaS spending. This is what we're seeing incredible ROI with - companies saving 15-30% on their SaaS budget within the first quarter.
>
> For this demo, let's explore the Enterprise features using our sample company, Acme Corporation."

### Actions:

- Hover over Personal card (highlight blue theme)
- Hover over Enterprise card (highlight purple theme)
- Click "View Demo" on Enterprise card

---

## 📝 SCENE 3: Enterprise Dashboard Overview (1:15 - 3:00)

### Visual: Enterprise Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/enterprise)

**Script:**

> "Welcome to the Acme Corporation dashboard. This is a company with 156 employees using 47 different SaaS tools, spending over $42,000 per month.
>
> Let's break down what we're seeing here..."

### Actions & Talking Points:

**Stats Overview (pause on each):**

- **Total Tools: 47**

  > "Our AI has discovered 47 unique SaaS tools across the organization - from obvious ones like Slack and Zoom, to shadow IT purchases made by individual teams."

- **Active Subscriptions: 42**

  > "42 active paid subscriptions with varying renewal dates and billing cycles."

- **Total Users: 156**

  > "156 employees, each with different tool access and usage patterns."

- **Monthly Spend: $42,350**

  > "That's over $42,000 per month, or just over half a million dollars annually in SaaS costs alone."

- **Potential Savings: $8,475**
  > "Here's where it gets interesting - our AI has identified $8,475 per month in potential savings. That's 20% of their monthly spend, or over $100,000 annually."

**Quick Wins Section:**

> "These Quick Wins are AI-generated recommendations prioritized by savings potential and confidence score."

- **Scroll through each quick win:**
  1. "Reduce Slack licenses - 32 users haven't logged in for 60+ days. Save $1,920 per month."
  2. "Cancel unused Figma seats - 12 seats with zero activity in 90 days. Save $1,440 per month."
  3. "Switch Zoom to Business plan - their Enterprise features are barely used. Save $950 per month."
  4. "Consolidate project management tools - teams are using both Asana and Monday.com. Save $1,250 per month."

**Utilization Summary:**

> "The utilization breakdown shows us the health of each subscription:
>
> - 18 tools are healthy with 60%+ utilization
> - 15 are moderate at 40-60%
> - But 11 are underutilized, and 3 are critical with less than 20% usage
>
> This underutilization represents $8,475 in monthly waste, or over $100,000 annually that's essentially being thrown away."

## 📝 SCENE 4: Decisions - AI Analysis (3:00 - 4:30)

### Visual: Navigate to Decisions page

**Script:**

> "Let's dive deeper into how our AI generates these recommendations. Click on 'Decisions' in the sidebar..."

### Actions:

- Show 3 decision cards

**Script:**

> "The Decisions page is where the magic happens. Let me show you how the AI analysis works in real-time."

### Actions: Click "Run Analysis" button

**Script (while analysis runs):**

> "When you click 'Run Analysis', our AI engine:
>
> - Analyzes user login patterns over the last 90 days
> - Evaluates feature utilization rates
> - Compares license counts to actual active users
> - Reviews historical usage trends
> - Applies industry benchmarks
>
> All of this happens in seconds..."

### Actions: Show alert with results

**Script:**

> "And here we go - 12 new decision recommendations created!
>
> Look at this breakdown:
>
> - Slack license reduction: $1,920/month savings
> - Figma seat cancellations: $1,440/month
> - Zoom plan downgrade: $950/month
>
> Total potential savings: $8,475 per month."

### Actions: Close alert, expand a decision card

**Script:**

> "Let's look at the details of one recommendation. Here's the Slack decision..."

### Show decision details:

> "Notice the confidence score - 92%. This is calculated based on:
>
> - 32 inactive users weighted at 40%
> - 18 low-activity users at 30%
> - Average message activity at 30%
>
> The risk score is only 15% - meaning this is a very safe decision with minimal business impact.
>
> We recommend reducing from 156 to 124 licenses, and we show exactly which users are inactive, when they last logged in, and why this is a safe change."

## 📝 SCENE 5: Subscriptions Management (4:30 - 5:45)

>
> Each subscription card shows critical information..."

### Actions: Point to each subscription

**Subscription 1: Slack**

> "Slack - $12,480 per month on their Business+ plan
>
> - 79.5% utilization (that's 124 active out of 156 paid seats)
> - Renewal in just 18 days - marked as urgent
> - This is a prime candidate for optimization"

**Subscription 2: GitHub**

> "GitHub - $3,480 per month
>
> - 100% utilization - every seat is being used
> - This is a healthy subscription, properly sized"

**Subscription 3: Zoom**

> "Zoom Enterprise - $1,900 per month
>
> - 87% utilization
> - But they're on the Enterprise plan and barely using enterprise features
> - Our AI recommends downgrading to Business plan"

**Subscription 4: Figma**

> "Figma - $360 per month
>
> - Only 60% utilization - 12 unused seats
> - Renewal in 45 days
> - Clear opportunity to reduce licenses"

**Subscription 5: Notion**

> "Notion - $1,200 per month
>
> - 91% utilization - healthy
> - Renewal in 8 days - this is well-managed"

### Actions: Show color-coded utilization

**Script:**

> "Notice the color coding:
>
> - Green means healthy (70%+ utilization)
> - Yellow means moderate (50-70%)
> - Orange means concerning (30-50%)
> - Red means critical (under 30%)
>
> This gives finance and IT teams instant visibility into subscription health."

## 📝 SCENE 6: Tools Discovery (5:45 - 6:45)

### Visual: Navigate to Tools page

### Actions:

> - Productivity (Notion, Asana, Monday.com)
> - And more...
>
> Each tool has a 'Keystone Score' - this is our measure of how critical it is to the business."

### Actions: Point to high-scoring tools

**Script:**

> "GitHub has a 9.8 keystone score - it's absolutely critical, with 22 dependencies. That means 22 other tools integrate with or depend on GitHub.
>
> Slack has a 9.2 score with 15 dependencies - also mission-critical.
>
> Compare that to Figma at 6.5 with only 3 dependencies - important for the design team, but less critical company-wide.
>
> This helps prioritize which tools need careful consideration before making changes."

### Actions: Show tool details

**Script:**

> "For each tool, we show:
>
> - Active users vs total users
> - Monthly cost
> - Dependencies and integrations
> - Status and category

### Actions: Point to specific users

**Users Overview:**

> "Sarah Johnson - VP of Engineering, Admin role, logged in 2 hours ago
>
> Michael Chen - Senior Developer, very active with a login 1 hour ago
>
> But look at this - 'Inactive User' - last logged in 90 days ago, but they're still assigned to multiple tools and licenses. This is exactly the kind of waste our AI catches.
>
> When someone leaves the company or changes roles, our system can automatically:
>
> - Identify their tool access
> - Recommend license removal
> - Trigger offboarding workflows
> - Prevent continued charges"

---
